# get_Panoptic_Studio_dataset
To get the opensource data from Panaptic Studio Datasets, we firstly download the HD videos from Panaptic Studio official website via the panoptic studio toolbox ;then we extract hd images from Hd videos  ,and get the 3D annotations(json files).
#convert cmu annotations to coco annotations
cmu annotations are 3D skeleton forms ,we need to convert it into 2D forms.
#caution!!!
when git clone the code , make sure your file directories are correct.
